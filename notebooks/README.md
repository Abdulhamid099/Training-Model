## Running Notebooks

1. **Install Jupyter**: `pip install jupyter`
2. **Start Jupyter**: `jupyter notebook`
3. **Navigate**: Open the notebook you want to run
4. **Run cells**: Execute cells sequentially

## Requirements

Make sure you have installed the project dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Tips

- Start with `01_quick_start.ipynb` to understand the basics
- Modify configurations in the notebooks to experiment with different settings
- Use GPU acceleration for faster training (if available)
- Save your trained models and results for later analysis

## Contributing

Feel free to add new notebooks or improve existing ones:
- Add clear documentation and comments
- Include example outputs where helpful
- Test notebooks with different configurations
- Share interesting findings and experiments
